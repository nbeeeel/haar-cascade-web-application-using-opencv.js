## Haar Cascade 
Haar Cascade is a machine learning based detector, used vastly for its speed and accuracy.
Here in this repository we've implemented a haar cascade based face and eyes detector using opencv.js. 
The code contains all the required files for running the detector on web.

## How to setup.
- Download VS Code 
- Install Live Server Extension
- [Copy and Download this code as opencv.js](https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.opencv.org%2F3.4.0%2Fopencv.js)
- [Download the frontal face and eye xml from here](https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fopencv%2Fopencv%2Ftree%2Fmaster%2Fdata%2Fhaarcascades)
- Put all the downloaded files in the same directory and adjust the location of these files in the respective code.

### Open the html file using the VS Code and live server. 

## Have Fun...
